Covid-map project:
    ☐ Tests
        ☐ postman tests for backend
            ☐ try accessing counties that dont exist
            ☐ time ranges that dont exist
        ☐ front end
            ☐ searching for counties that dont exist
            ☐ time ranges that dont exist
    ☐ Full-site things
        ✔ Color changes (maybe light and dark mode) @done(21-12-05 21:35)
        ☐ Make it so you can just start typing to search
            this is so you dont really need a mouse to make the site work
    ☐ Searchbar
        ☐ Search for entire states
            ☐ combine all counties
        ✔ deal with the submits of counties that don't exist. @done(21-12-05 21:35)
            Do i just choose the closest county
            do i put a little message that the county doesnt exist
            do i do nothing
        ☐ Zoom into the state of the county that is slected
            maybe we should color it differntly or change the outline maybe add a shadow to it so it almost pops out
    ☐ Sidebar
        I think it will default display the most recent results up top (1 day view)
        The graph will then show the trends for default the last month
        ✔ Collapsable @done(21-12-05 21:35)
            ✔ Arrow that closes it @done(21-12-05 21:35)
            ✔ Animated @done(21-12-05 21:35)
        ☐ Add Graph
            ☐ Shows trends
        ☐ Timescales
    ☐ Map
        ☐ QOL
            ☐ Smooth pan and zoom
            ☐ hover over styling
            ☐ Zoom in on click to atleast the state
            ☐ Show state names and maybe top X cities
                I think this is going to be the hardest part.
        ☐ Choropleth map
            ☐ Different Layers
                This will need some general api calls
                ☐ Infection Rate
                    /api/getInfectionRate
                    This call will need to return the most recet infection rate for all counties
                    maybe it returns it sorted to create the range
                    ☐ Maybe we can eventually even add in support for other dates (-30 days, -90 days, etc)
                ☐ Vaccination Rate
                    /api/getVaccinationRate

                ☐ Deaths
                    /api/getDeaths
                ☐ Maybe a little slidebar at the bottom that allows the changing of date
    ☐ Yarn script to start the backend
        Maybe even a script to start the whole thing
    ☐ Other items
        ☐ compare the county to the state
        ☐ compare the county to another county
        ☐ compare state to state
        ☐ compare x to country
    ✔ Add support for backend @done(21-11-15 15:16)
    ✔ Split updater from the server @done(21-11-15 15:12)
        this will allow easier restarting of the server, currently on every restart the data needs to be downloaded
    ✔ Add fips support @done(21-11-15 15:12)
    ✔ Searchbar QOL @done(21-11-03 13:48)
        ✔ clicking on item in dropdown auto submits @done(21-11-03 13:48)
        ✔ using arrow keys fills in the search bar @done(21-11-03 13:48)
    ✔ Slight bounds issue the west coast bound is a little too far over @done(21-11-03 13:55)
        ✔ move and scale puerto rico @done(21-10-27 12:13)
        ✔ move the state @done(21-10-27 12:03)
        ✔ move the counties @done(21-10-27 12:13)
    ✔ bounding box @done(21-10-27 12:03)
    ✔ move map to its own component @done(21-11-01 11:00)
    ✘ make it so when hovered over the empty area no state is highlighted @cancelled(21-11-02 22:19)
        I no longer only render the state initially. 
    ✔ hawaii is broken @done(21-11-01 12:46)
    ✔ search bar @done(21-11-01 13:17)
        ✔ fix special characters in names of counties @done(21-10-27 13:41)
        ✔ create autocomplete data @done(21-10-27 13:45)
        ✔ create the data to relate search terms to fips code @done(21-10-27 13:56)
        ✔ create component @done(21-11-01 10:54)
        ✔ style @done(21-11-01 13:17)
            ✔ move to center @done(21-11-01 13:17)
            ✔ appear over the map @done(21-11-01 13:17)
            ✔ color scheme @done(21-11-01 13:17)
    ✔ hover over county boxes @done(21-11-02 22:15)
        have it just show the name of the county
    
    ✔ side panel @done(21-11-02 22:20)
        this is where the covid data will show, i need the think about what the default state of this area should be
        maybe its just blank, or maybe when you click the map or search the style changes to the move the map to left instead of it being centered
        ✔ when a user searches for a  county this area is updated @done(21-11-02 20:39)
            ✔ convert map to component @done(21-11-02 15:58)
                this fill fix a lingering issue where the map is disjoint of the rest of the program.
            ✔ make it so the map size is updated when the sidebar is created, this will allow for the sidebar to have room @done(21-11-02 17:03)

         
        ✔ when a user clicks on a county this area is updated @done(21-11-02 20:39)
            ✘ move relational.json to be more accessable to documents that require it @cancelled(21-11-02 20:39)
                This wasn't needed, instead another file was generated to house what each state was.

    ✔ upload to github @done(21-11-01 13:40)
    ✔ small issue with the naming conventin in the county data ("baltimore" used twice for mayland as "baltimore city" doesn't exist by name) @done(21-11-02 22:15)
        ✔ I need to find all duplicate values in the autocomplete.json file @done(21-11-02 22:14)
            These are the instances where multiple similar names can't be differentiated in terms of FIPS which creates an issue where two
            different counties retrieve the same data.
            Interesting Case
                Beford, VA - In 2013 the county and the city recombined
                    This will need to be evaluated based off the data from NYT 
                    For now i renamed the county to Bedford County
